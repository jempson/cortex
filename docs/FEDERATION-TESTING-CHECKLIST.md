**Version:** v1.13.0
**Last Updated:** December 2025

This checklist covers end-to-end testing of the Cortex federation feature.

---

## Prerequisites

### Environment Setup

- [ ] **Server A** running on port 3001 (e.g., `cortex-a.local`)
- [ ] **Server B** running on port 3002 (e.g., `cortex-b.local`)
- [ ] Both servers have `FEDERATION_ENABLED=true`
- [ ] Both servers have unique `FEDERATION_NODE_NAME` values
- [ ] Both servers using SQLite (`USE_SQLITE=true`) for full federation support
- [ ] Admin accounts on both servers

### Test Accounts

| Server | Handle | Role | Password |
|--------|--------|------|----------|
| Server A | `admin-a` | Admin | (your password) |
| Server A | `user-a` | User | (your password) |
| Server B | `admin-b` | Admin | (your password) |
| Server B | `user-b` | User | (your password) |

## 1. Server Identity Setup

### 1.1 Generate Identity (Server A)

- [ ] Login as admin on Server A
- [ ] Navigate to Profile Settings → Federation (admin section)
- [ ] Click "Generate Identity"
- [ ] Verify RSA public key is displayed
- [ ] Verify node name matches `FEDERATION_NODE_NAME`

### 1.2 Generate Identity (Server B)

- [ ] Repeat steps for Server B
- [ ] Confirm different public key generated

### 1.3 Identity Endpoint Test

```bash
# Test Server A identity endpoint (no auth required)
curl http://localhost:3001/api/federation/identity

# Expected: { nodeName, publicKey, createdAt }
```

- [ ] Returns 200 with valid JSON
- [ ] Public key is PEM format
- [ ] Node name matches configuration

---

## 2. Node Trust Setup

### 2.1 Add Server B as Trusted Node (on Server A)

- [ ] In Federation panel, click "Add Node"
- [ ] Enter Server B's node name
- [ ] Enter Server B's base URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3002`)
- [ ] Node appears in list with status "pending"

### 2.2 Add Server A as Trusted Node (on Server B)

- [ ] Repeat for Server A on Server B
- [ ] Both nodes show as "pending"

### 2.3 Initiate Handshake

- [ ] On Server A, click "Handshake" for Server B node
- [ ] Verify Server B's public key is fetched and stored
- [ ] Status changes to "active"
- [ ] On Server B, click "Handshake" for Server A node
- [ ] Both nodes show "active" status

### 2.4 Handshake API Test

```bash
# Get nodes list (admin auth required)
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  http://localhost:3001/api/admin/federation/nodes

# Expected: { nodes: [{ id, nodeName, baseUrl, status, publicKey, ... }] }
```

- [ ] Returns list of trusted nodes
- [ ] Active nodes have public keys populated

---

## 3. User Resolution

### 3.1 Resolve Local User

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  http://localhost:3001/api/users/resolve/admin-a

# Expected: { user: { ..., isLocal: true } }
```

- [ ] Returns local user with `isLocal: true`

### 3.2 Resolve Federated User

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  http://localhost:3001/api/users/resolve/@user-b@cortex-b.local

# Expected: { user: { ..., isLocal: false, nodeName: "cortex-b.local" } }
```

- [ ] Returns federated user with `isLocal: false`
- [ ] User is cached in `remote_users` table
- [ ] Subsequent requests return cached data

### 3.3 Invalid User Resolution

```bash
curl -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>" \
  http://localhost:3001/api/users/resolve/@nonexistent@unknown.server

# Expected: 404 error
```

- [ ] Returns 404 for unknown federated users

---

## 4. Federated Wave Creation

### 4.1 Create Wave with Federated Participant

On Server A as `user-a`:

- [ ] Create new wave with title "Federation Test"
- [ ] Add local participant: `admin-a`
- [ ] Add federated participant: `@user-b@cortex-b.local`
- [ ] Wave created successfully

### 4.2 Verify Wave Invitation Sent

- [ ] Check Server A logs for outbound federation message
- [ ] Message type should be `wave_invite`
- [ ] Check `federation_queue` table if message queued

### 4.3 Verify Wave Received on Server B

On Server B as `user-b`:

- [ ] Wave appears in wave list
- [ ] Wave shows correct title and participants
- [ ] Wave marked as federated (participant server)

---

## 5. Federated Droplet Exchange

### 5.1 Send Droplet from Origin Server

On Server A as `user-a`:

- [ ] Open federated wave
- [ ] Send droplet: "Hello from Server A!"
- [ ] Droplet appears locally

### 5.2 Verify Droplet Received on Participant Server

On Server B as `user-b`:

- [ ] Droplet appears in wave
- [ ] Author shown as `user-a@cortex-a.local`
- [ ] Content matches original
- [ ] Droplet stored in `remote_droplets` table

### 5.3 Send Reply from Participant Server

On Server B as `user-b`:

- [ ] Reply to droplet: "Hello from Server B!"
- [ ] Reply appears locally

### 5.4 Verify Reply Received on Origin Server

On Server A:

- [ ] Reply appears in wave thread
- [ ] Author shown as `user-b@cortex-b.local`

---

## 6. Droplet Edit/Delete Propagation

## 7. Message Queue & Retry

### 7.1 Test Queue Processing

-- remote_droplets, wave_federation, federation_queue, federation_inbox_log
```

- [ ] Indexes exist for performance

### 12.2 Data Consistency

- [ ] `wave_federation` links waves to nodes correctly
