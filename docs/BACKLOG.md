# Cortex Feature Backlog

Future feature ideas and enhancements for consideration.

---

## ✅ App Rename & Space-Based Nomenclature Overhaul (COMPLETED in v2.0.0)

**Status:** Implemented in v2.0.0 (January 2026)

### Background

Cortex was created as an homage to *Firefly* and *Serenity*, inspired by the Cortex - the 'Verse's interconnected network of databanks and communication systems. The original terminology used water-based metaphors (Waves, Droplets, Ripple), but the v2.0.0 nomenclature overhaul brought space/Firefly-themed naming to better honor the source material and create a more cohesive identity.

### App Rename

The app name "Cortex" should change to something more obscure that represents the "entry point into the Cortex" - the Cortex being the entire network of federated nodes in the 'Verse.

**Chosen Name: Cortex**
- Domain: **cortex.com** (confirmed available, along with .net, .org, .io)
- Meaning: "Your hold in the far reaches of the 'Verse"
- Short, memorable, evokes frontier/Rim worlds aesthetic
- Works as both a noun ("the Cortex") and a place ("welcome to Cortex")

### Terminology Changes

| Current | New | Context |
|---------|-----|---------|
| Cortex | **Cortex** | App name (entry point to the Cortex) |
| Droplet | **Ping** | Individual message |
| Ripple | **Burst** | Break out thread to new conversation |
| Group | **Crew** | User groups |
| Wave | **Wave** | Keep - canonical Firefly ("send a wave") |
| Contact | **Contact** | Keep as-is |

### Federation Terminology

| Current | Proposed | Reasoning |
|---------|----------|-----------|
| Federation | **The Verse** | The interconnected network of instances |
| Federated Server | **Port** or **Outpost** | Docking locations in the 'Verse |
| Federation Handshake | **Docking** | Ships dock to exchange |
| Remote User | **Traveler** | Someone from another port |
| Federation Sync | **Signal Relay** | Passing waves through the black |
| Trusted Nodes | **Allied Ports** | Trusted connections |
| Federation Queue | **Cargo Hold** | Outbound messages waiting for delivery |

### Firefly Easter Eggs

**Success States:**
- "Shiny!" - Operation successful
- "Wave sent" → "Signal's away"
- "Connected" → "We're in the air"

**Error States:**
- "Gorram it!" - Generic error prefix
- "Lost signal" - Connection failed
- "Ship's grounded" - Server unreachable
- "Alliance interference" - Access denied

**Empty States:**
- "Nothing but black out here" - No messages
- "Crew's elsewhere" - No one online
- "Ain't heard a peep" - No notifications

**Loading States:**
- "Spinning up..." - Loading
- "Scanning the cortex..." - Searching
- "Awaiting docking clearance..." - Connecting to federation

**Confirmations:**
- "I aim to misbehave" - Admin/destructive action confirmation
- "Let's be bad guys" - Delete confirmation
- "Time to go to work" - Task starting

**Taglines/Footer Rotation:**
- "Can't stop the signal"
- "Keep flying"
- "We're still flying, that's something"
- "You can't take the sky from me"
- "Privacy isn't a feature, it's a foundation" (keep original)
- "Find a crew, find a job, keep flying"
- "I don't care what you believe, just believe in it"

**Profile/Settings:**
- "Captain's Log" - Activity log
- "Ship's Manifest" - Account data export
- "Abandon Ship" - Delete account

**Notifications:**
- "Wave incoming" - New message
- "Ping from the black" - Mention
- "Crew assembled" - Added to group
- "New traveler docked" - Federated user joined

### UI Text Examples

**Current → New:**
- "No droplets yet" → "Ain't heard a ping yet"
- "Send a droplet" → "Send a ping"
- "Ripple to new wave" → "Burst to new wave"
- "Create group" → "Assemble a crew"
- "Group members" → "Crew manifest"
- "Leave group" → "Jump ship"
- "Add to group" → "Recruit to crew"
- "Federate wave" → "Broadcast to the Verse"
- "Connected servers" → "Allied ports"

### Implementation Scope

**Phase 1: App Rename & Domain** ✅
- ~~Acquire new domain~~
- ~~Update branding, logos, PWA manifest~~
- ~~Redirect old domain (if applicable)~~

**Phase 2: Core Renames** ✅
- ~~Ping (messages), Burst (breakout), Crew (groups)~~
- ~~Database migrations with backward compatibility~~
- ~~API endpoint aliases during transition~~

**Phase 3: UI Text Overhaul** ✅
- ~~All user-facing strings updated~~
- Easter egg messages throughout (future enhancement)
- Loading/error/empty state personality (future enhancement)

**Phase 4: Federation Theming** (Future)
- Federation UI terminology
- Admin panel updates
- Documentation refresh

### Database Migration Notes

```sql
-- Tables to rename
ALTER TABLE droplets RENAME TO pings;
ALTER TABLE droplet_read_by RENAME TO ping_read_by;
ALTER TABLE droplets_fts RENAME TO pings_fts;
ALTER TABLE groups RENAME TO crews;
ALTER TABLE group_members RENAME TO crew_members;
ALTER TABLE group_invitations RENAME TO crew_invitations;

-- Columns referencing old terms
-- (broken_out_to stays but UI shows "burst")
```

## Privacy Hardening: Metadata Protection

**Priority:** High

### Background

E2EE protects message content, but metadata can reveal just as much. If someone gains database access, they shouldn't be able to "connect the dots" - who talks to whom, when, or how often. Our privacy claims must match our actual security posture.

### Current State (After v2.18.0)

| Data Point | Current State | Risk Level |
|------------|---------------|------------|
| Email addresses | ✅ Hashed + Encrypted | **Low** - Protected |
| IP addresses | ✅ Anonymized to /24 subnet | **Low** - Protected |
| User-Agent | ✅ Truncated to Browser/OS | **Low** - Protected |
| Timestamps | ✅ Rounded (15-min activity, 5-min sessions) | **Low** - Protected |
| Session data | ✅ 30-day auto-cleanup | **Low** - Protected |
| Activity logs | ✅ 30-day auto-cleanup | **Low** - Protected |
| Contact lists | ✅ Client-encrypted blob (v2.18.0) | **Low** - Protected |
| User → Wave relationships | Visible in DB | **High** - Shows who talks to whom |
| Crew membership | Stored per-user | **High** - Group associations exposed |
| Push subscriptions | Tied to user IDs | **Medium** - Device correlation |
| Avatars | Stored with user ID | **Low** - Potential recognition |

**What's protected:** Message content (E2EE), emails, IPs, user-agents, timestamps, contact lists
**What's still exposed:** Social graph (wave participation, crews)

### Implementation Progress

**Phase 1: Data Minimization** ✅ COMPLETED (v2.17.0)
- ✅ Hash emails (SHA-256 for lookup)
- ✅ Encrypt emails (AES-256-GCM for password reset)
- ✅ Anonymize IPs (truncate to /24 subnet)
- ✅ Truncate User-Agent (Browser/OS only)
- ✅ Round timestamps (15-min for activity, 5-min for sessions)
- ✅ Auto-cleanup activity logs (30 days default)
- ✅ Auto-cleanup old sessions (30 days default)
- ✅ Admin endpoints for migration and status

**Phase 2: Encrypted Metadata** 🔄 IN PROGRESS (v2.18.0)
- ✅ Encrypt contact lists (only user can decrypt their own)
- Encrypt wave participation lists
- Server knows wave exists, but not who's in it
- Encrypted push subscription mapping

**Phase 3: Social Graph Protection** (Future)
- Wave IDs are random, not sequential (already done)
- No global user directory (must know handle to find)
- Rate-limited handle lookups
- Encrypted crew membership lists

**Phase 4: Plausible Deniability** (Future)
- Hidden waves (don't appear in lists)
- Decoy traffic for federation
- Can't prove user is in a wave without their key

### Environment Variables (v2.17.0)

```bash
EMAIL_ENCRYPTION_KEY=<32-byte-hex>  # openssl rand -hex 32
ACTIVITY_LOG_RETENTION_DAYS=30
SESSION_MAX_AGE_DAYS=30
```

### Admin Endpoints (v2.17.0)

- `POST /api/admin/maintenance/migrate-emails` - Migrate existing users to encrypted email
- `GET /api/admin/maintenance/privacy-status` - View privacy protection stats

### Success Criteria

- [x] Database breach reveals no plaintext emails (v2.17.0)
- [x] IPs cannot identify specific users (v2.17.0)
- [x] Cannot correlate activity patterns via precise timestamps (v2.17.0)
- [x] Contact lists encrypted, server cannot read them (v2.18.0)
- [ ] Cannot determine who is in which wave from DB alone
- [ ] Cannot reconstruct social graph from DB
- [ ] Privacy policy accurately reflects actual protections

## ✅ Crawl Bar: Pause + Drag Interaction (COMPLETED in v2.0.3)

**Status:** Implemented in v2.0.3 (January 2026)

### Summary

### Implementation

- **Pause on hover/touch**: Animation pauses when user hovers (desktop) or touches (mobile)
- **Drag to scroll**: Click and drag left/right to manually scroll through content
- **Auto-resume**: Animation resumes from current position after 3 seconds of no interaction
- **Visual indicators**: Amber border glow, pause icon (⏸), drag arrows (◀ ▶), grab cursor
