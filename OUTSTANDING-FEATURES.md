## Outstanding Features

### 1. Export Wave as PDF/HTML
**Complexity:** Medium

Export entire waves for archival or sharing.

- Export wave with all pings, attachments, and media
- Formatted HTML or PDF output preserving threading structure
- Include participant metadata
- `GET /api/waves/:id/export?format=pdf|html`

---

### 2. Advanced Search Filters
**Complexity:** Medium

Enhanced search with advanced filters and boolean operators.

- Boolean operators: AND, OR, NOT
- Exact phrase matching with quotes
- Filter by: author, date range, wave privacy level, has:media, has:reactions
- Sort by: relevance, date, author
- Saved search queries

---

### 3. End-to-End Encryption for Federation
**Complexity:** High

Extend E2EE to federated messages between servers.

- Key exchange between federated users across different servers
- Secure key distribution via federation protocol
- Handle key rotation for multi-server participants
- **Current status:** Local E2EE works (v2.1.0), federated waves send ciphertext but keys are not exchanged between servers

---

## Future Considerations

### Advanced API & Integrations
- OAuth Provider: Third-party app authentication
- GraphQL API: Alternative to REST

### Advanced Moderation
